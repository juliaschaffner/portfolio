## Overview

*Guten Morgen, Berlin* (*Good Morning, Berlin*) is a short film I created while studying abroad in Berlin, Germany in Fall 2024. The film captures my personal connection to the cityâ€”its rhythm, its people, and the late nights that blur into dawn. My goal was to bring Berlin to life through my own eyes in under ten minutes.

## Story

The narrative exaggerates my own disrupted sleep schedule during my time abroad. The protagonist awakens in the middle of the night, ventures out with friends, and returns home just as the sun risesâ€”reflecting Berlinâ€™s unique energy and nightlife.

## Inspiration

Living in Berlin deeply influenced the project. The cityâ€™s atmosphere, culture, and people shaped the story and visuals, grounding the film in authenticity.

## Music

The soundtrack was curated from music I listened to during that semester. Each track was chosen to mirror the mood of the city and enhance the storytelling.
